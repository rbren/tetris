# OpenVibe Hello World Repository

## Overview

OpenVibe Hello World is a modern React application built with Vite and deployed on Fly.io using Nginx. The project demonstrates best practices for React development with a clean, component-based architecture optimized for cloud deployment.

## Key Features

- **React 19**: Built with the latest React version using modern hooks and patterns
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development server and build tool
- **React Router**: Client-side routing with multiple pages (Home, About, Contact)
- **Theme Context**: Built-in theme management system
- **Component Architecture**: Well-organized components (Header, Footer) and pages
- **Testing Setup**: Comprehensive testing with Vitest and React Testing Library
- **Modern Tooling**: ESLint configuration for code quality
- **Nginx Deployment**: Optimized static file serving with Nginx

## Development Workflow

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Never run this application locally!**

Instead, always follow this workflow:
1. Make your changes to the codebase
2. Push changes to GitHub
3. Create a Pull Request
4. Deploy to Fly.io for testing and preview

This ensures consistent deployment and testing environments for all contributors.

## Backend Development Guidelines

For any backend functionality, always use Fly.io's serverless and managed services:

- **Fly.io Machines**: For serverless backend functions and APIs
- **Fly.io Postgres**: Use Fly.io's managed PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Fly.io Redis**: Use Fly.io's Redis for caching and sessions
- **Fly.io Object Storage**: For file uploads and static assets
- **Container-based deployment**: All services run in Docker containers on Fly.io

### Backend Architecture Recommendations
- Create separate Fly.io apps for backend APIs if needed
- Use Fly.io Postgres for persistent data storage
- Use Fly.io Redis for caching, session storage, and real-time features
- Keep services lightweight and stateless where possible
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Connect frontend to backend APIs via HTTPS endpoints

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, React Router DOM
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, jsdom
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with React-specific rules
- **Styling**: CSS with component-scoped styles
- **Web Server**: Nginx (for static file serving)
- **Database**: Fly.io Postgres (when needed)
- **Cache/Sessions**: Fly.io Redis (when needed)
- **Deployment**: Fly.io with Docker containers

## Available Scripts

### Frontend (React)
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (DO NOT USE - see workflow above)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` - Run tests once
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix linting issues automatically

### Deployment (Fly.io)
- `fly deploy` - Deploy to Fly.io (after pushing to GitHub)
- `fly logs` - View application logs
- `fly status` - Check application status
- `fly open` - Open the deployed application in browser

## Fly.io Configuration

The application is configured for Fly.io deployment with:

### Multi-stage Docker Build
1. **Build Stage**: Node.js environment builds the React application
2. **Production Stage**: Nginx serves the built static files

### Deployment Features
- **Static file serving**: Nginx optimized for React SPA
- **Auto-scaling**: Configured to scale to zero when not in use
- **HTTPS**: Force HTTPS enabled for security
- **Geographic distribution**: Deployed in `ewr` region with global edge caching
- **Resource optimization**: 1GB memory, shared CPU for cost efficiency

### Container Configuration
- **Port 80**: Internal Nginx port
- **Auto-stop/start**: Machines automatically stop when idle and start on demand
- **Minimal resource usage**: Optimized for cost-effective hosting

## Adding Backend Services

When you need backend functionality:

1. **Create a separate Fly.io app** for your API server
2. **Use Fly.io's managed services** (Postgres, Redis) 
3. **Connect via environment variables** and HTTPS endpoints
4. **Deploy backend and frontend independently** for better scalability
5. **Use CORS configuration** to allow frontend-backend communication

This architecture keeps the frontend fast and lightweight while providing flexibility for backend services as needed.
